# Discover Algorithms for Reward-Based Learning in R [Video]
This is the code repository for [Discover Algorithms for Reward-Based Learning in R [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/discover-algorithms-reward-based-learning-r-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788474092), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Users will be taken through a journey that starts by showing them the various algorithms that can be used for reward-based learning. The video describes and compares the range of model-based and model-free learning algorithms that constitute RL algorithms.

The Course starts by describing the differences in model-free and model-based approaches to Reinforcement Learning. It discusses the characteristics, advantages and disadvantages, and typical examples of model-free and model-based approaches.
We look at model-based approaches to Reinforcement Learning.We discuss State-value and State-action value functions, Model-based iterative policy evaluation, and improvement, MDP R examples of moving a pawn, how the discount factor, gamma, “works” and an R example illustrating how the discount factor and relative rewards affect policy. Next, we learn the model-free approach to Reinforcement Learning.This includes Monte Carlo approach, Q-Learning approach, More Q-Learning explanation and R examples of varying the learning rate and randomness of actions and SARSA approach. Finally, we round things up by taking a look at model-free Simulated Annealing and more Q-Learning algorithms.

The primary aim is to learn how to create efficient, goal-oriented business policies, and how to evaluate and optimize those policies, primarily using the MDPtoolbox package in R. Finally, the video shows how to build actions, rewards, and punishments with a simulated annealing approach.
